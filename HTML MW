        Ragnar "Lothbrok" Sigurdsson (Old Norse: Ragnarr Loðbrók, Ragnar means "keeper of the fort" and Lothbrok means "shaggy breeches") is a Viking farmer and warrior who yearns to raid the rumored riches of undiscovered England.
         His first wife is Lagertha, and they have two children named Gyda and Bjorn.
          His second wife is Aslaug, and they have four sons named Ubbe, Hvitserk, Sigurd, and Ivar.
           Ragnar is the younger brother of Rollo.
            He becomes King of Kattegat.</p>

        <h2>Lagertha Lothbrok</h2>
        Lagertha was brought up by her father to be a shield-maiden.
         At an unspecified time, Ragnar went to Lagertha's home to confess his love for her, but he was set upon by a bear and an enormous hound who guarded her home.
          Ragnar killed the bear with his spear and strangled the hound with his bare hands, thus gaining her hand in marriage.
           It is unknown if Ragnar's story is real or a child-friendly tale to his son Björn referencing his battle with Rollo, who was known as a "bear," over Lagertha's love, as Lagertha also had a relationship with Rollo and is unsure who Björn's biological father is.</p>

        Aslaug Sigurdsdottir is the second wife of Ragnar Lothbrok.
         She is the former Queen of Kattegat and the mother of Ubbe, Hvitserk, Sigurd, and Ivar. 
         She is believed to be a völva, meaning she can see the future through visions.
          Aslaug is a Götaland princess. 
          She is the clever and beautiful daughter of the famed dragon slayer Sigurd, a hero in the sagas who slew the dragon Fafnir, and shield-maiden Brynhildr.
           Both of her parents died before she got to know either of them, and she learned social skills and refinement over a warrior's skills.                        </p>
